As a recent Computer Science graduate, I have transitioned from exploring diverse
academic fields to a dedicated focus on software engineering. Throughout my time at
university and in my role as a Cocktail Bartender, I have honed my skills in creating
memorable guest experiences and building lasting relationships, underscoring the
value of teamwork and customer engagement in any environment.

My technical proficiency encompasses intermediate skills in systems programming
languages like Rust and C, coupled with experience in web development using HTML,
CSS, and the modern framework Tailwind CSS for crafting engaging front-end designs.
Additionally, my venture into the realm of Deep Learning, particularly in Python, was
marked by a collaborative student project utilizing the YOLOv5 model for object
detection.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in Rust with the aim of developing secure,
enterprise-level software. I am eager to embark on a career in Software Engineering,
seeking a role that allows me to contribute to a team's success in developing or
refining innovative products or services. My goal is to further my skills in a
collaborative engineering environment, focusing on solutions that enhance
productivity and user experience.
